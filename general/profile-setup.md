- On the Meta Quest headsets, opening the app for the first time, it should auto login with your quest user.

- To see what user is logged see the profile section of the main menu. 

- If you are not on quest or wish to create a user not associated with the meta account, you can log out and create a new user. 

- Loggin out can be done from your profile page 

- Creating non meta quest user is possible via the app

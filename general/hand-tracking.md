Make sure to [turn on hand tracking in horizon OS](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-hand-tracking/)

Now laying your controllers down should automatically enable hand tracking by default.
> **Reccomendation**: Turn off the Quest setting "Automatically switch between controllers and hands" this doesnt work so well we reccomend to use the "Double tap controllers for hand tracking" settings.

When hand tracking is active here are the basic controls:
- Grip button = 5 finger pinch, Or Fist
- Trigger button = Index finger touch thumb (pointing outwards)
- Grip + Trigger together = fist
- Main menu open/close = left hand index touch thumb (pointing up)
- Actions (radial) menu = middle finger touch thumb (with index finger pointing up)

1. Hold **fist** on empty space to "grab" the air and pull yourself and move around, we call this locomotion method [Swimming](/general/locomotion).
2. Holding **fist** on an item will grab it
3. Touching index finger to thumb is used for tweaking interfaces, changing numbers, pulling handles and creating patching wires
4. Touching all 5 fingers in a pinch will grab objects


Check out the interactive tutorial in the PatchWorld landing world for more.

You can disable hand tracking via the settings [settings](/patching/settings)

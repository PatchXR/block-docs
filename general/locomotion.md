# VR Platforms Locomotion

### Swimming
You can swim around inside worlds in all direction by pressing and holding the Trigger + Grip buttons on either or both hands, doing so will “grab” a point in space and will let you move yourself in relation to that point.
 
1. Extend your arm
2. Press and hold the Trigger + Grip buttons
3. Slowly pull your arm towards your body
4. Let go of the button

Repeating while alternating with both hands feels like walking.

### Flying
Repeat the steps above but do the pulling swiftly and let go of the buttons while pulling.
This will throw you in that direction.

### Turning

2. Move one controller around the other one 
Result: You just changed your angle in relation to the world around you without turning your body.

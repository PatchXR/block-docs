## What's New 

### Asset Permissions & Logic Corrections
We have refined the ownership system to ensure consistent behavior across the platform. Paid content is now properly protected (including nested parts, for both freshly spawned and world dependencies)

**Refined Permission Logic**
Here is a breakdown of how interactions now work based on ownership:

| Device Type | Open | Save As | Ungroup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Your Own** | ✓ | ✓ (Save) | ✓ |
| **Free (Not Yours)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Paid + Purchased** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Paid + Not Purchased** | → Info Page | ✗ | ✗ |

*   **Fix:** **Free Devices:** "Save As" and "Ungroup" are now correctly enabled for free devices found in other users' worlds.
*   **Fix:** **Paid Content Protection:** Fixed an issue where restricted content inside a device wasn't inheriting protections. Content inside a paid device now remains fully restricted.
*   **Fix:**  Opening a paid device you meet in some world do not own now redirects you to its Asset Info page (instead of opening the device)
*   **New:** **Media Saving:** You can now use "Save As" on individual media assets via radial menu (Images, Audio, Video) found in worlds to save a copy directly to your library.

### Asset Info Page Facelift
*   **Creator Card:** The Creator field now features a clickable avatar and username—tap to view that creator's full library.
*   **New Stats:** Added a **"Spawned"** count and an interactive **"Likes"** button.
*   **Timestamps:** Added an **"Updated"** date field so you can see when an asset was last modified.
*   **Status Indicators:** Added a **"Purchased"** badge (with date) for assets you own.
*   **Workflow:** The Info Page now opens automatically after creating or saving a new device, allowing you to immediately edit the name and description.

### Thumbnail Picker
*   **Spawn Camera:** Added a "Spawn Camera" button directly in the thumbnail grid. If no images exist in the world, you can quickly spawn a camera to take one.
*   **Smart Fallback:** If the specific camera asset fails to load, the system now automatically falls back to spawning a standard snapcam block.

### Inspector & UX Improvements
*   **Inspector Layout:** The "Open Asset Page" button has been moved to the very top of the inspector for faster access.
*   **Library Sorting:** The sorting filter functionality was improved.
*   **Bug Fix:** **Controller Tips:** Fixed a bug where controller tooltips/hints would remain visible even while holding or using objects.
*   **Bug Fix:** **Library Stability:** Clicking "Open Asset Page" now correctly initializes the Library in the background if it wasn't already open this session.
*   **Bug Fix:** Fixed accidental text highlighting when scrolling through the library web view.
*   **Settings:** Brought back the **"Reload Library"** button in Settings to force a refresh if content is missing (requires internet).

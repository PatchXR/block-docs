## What’s New ✨

### 🧱 New & Improved Blocks
- **Make Physical Extra (New)**  
  New block with expanded physics options, including better Multiplayer support and physics toggling.
- **Controller Output Block**  
  Buttons and joysticks can now be disabled for UI or gameplay, reserving them exclusively for block logic.
- **Procedural Line Block**  
  Can now face a custom direction instead of always facing the player (inspector option).
- **Particles Block**  
  - New jolt input to manually emit a specific number of particles  
  - Helper sphere is no longer visible in Play mode
- **Constant Block**  
  Now indicates whether the game is in Play or Edit mode.
- **Spawn Blocks**  
  Added text input mode for dynamic asset spawning.
- **Groups**  
  New option: *Collide When Hidden*, even when not physical.

### 🎮 Multiplayer & Physics Improvements
- Improved physics stability to reduce cases where players could get unexpectedly flung
- Fixed jolt execution order in specific Android situations
- Player output order is now consistent across all players
- Player mass standardized to 60kg for more stable physics behavior
- Raycasts now ignore triggers and non-collidable blocks

---

### 🛠 Editor & Workflow Improvements
- Tooltips are now customizable
- Hovering interactive parts without documentation now shows the block’s main tooltip
- Sliders now output values even if the value hasn’t changed
- Fixed dials becoming broken after out-of-range values and duplication
- Easier jolt connections on Integrator blocks
- Fixed stream inputs that were difficult or impossible to edit
- Follow Block: “Keep offset” is now off by default for clearer behavior
- Shapes have lower hover priority, making UI easier to interact with on their surfaces
- Slider interaction areas tightened to avoid disturbing neighboring blocks

---

### 🧩 Materials, Visuals & Performance
- **Set Material Block**  
  Smoothness and Metallic features merged to significantly reduce shader variants and memory usage
- Reduced texture sizes and removed heavy meshes to improve low-memory performance

---

### 🛒 Purchases & Input Fixes
- Fixed WebView and library text input issues (selection duplication, keyboard closing)
- Copy/Paste is now allowed *within* purchased devices for customization, while still preventing content extraction
- Improved stability when copying, duplicating, or grouping paid device content

---

### 🐞 Fixes & Stability
- Fixed Make Hittable not outputting non-physical colliders
- Variables now update correctly when becoming restricted
- Prevented rare freezes caused by variable or selector recursion
- Fixed jolt ordering issues in specific edge cases

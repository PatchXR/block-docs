# What’s New Since 77.0.4

This page summarizes changes introduced **after version 77.0.4**, up to **build 77.0.6 (882)**.

## Logic Blocks & Behavior Fixes

### Foreach Block
- Fixed glitches when `Foreach` was executed **multiple times per frame**.
- Added a new **“Once Per Frame”** limit setting in the Inspector:
  - Default: **ON**
  - Prevents unintended multiple executions within the same frame.

---

## Stability & Error Prevention

## Multiplayer

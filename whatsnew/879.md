### Features & Enhancements

*   **Gen AI / 3D Generation:**
    *   Added `gen_mesh` console command to generate 3D models from images. Supports Asset IDs, URLs, and local file paths (with auto-upload).
    *   Extended the `GetName` block with an `OutputMode` enum, allowing users to retrieve Asset ID, Path, URL, or Path/URL.
    *   Optimized Gen AI downloads to fetch only the specific asset rather than triggering a full library sync.
*   **Asset Inspector:**
    *   Added Asset Info display (Owner info, "Open Asset Page" button) to the Inspector for Samples, Images, Videos, and 360 assets.
    *   Added `is360` toggle to video assets on the info page.
    *   Added conversion options for Video and 360 Video within the in-app inspector.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Set display time to 8000ms for both world descriptions and jokes/quotes (refactored to use a shared constant).

### Fixes

*   **Save & Upload (Ghosts):**
    *   Fixed an issue on Android where updating a saved world containing ghosts would get stuck on "Uploading to Cloud".
    *   **Safe Copy:** Implemented a "safe copy" fix to handle cases where destination files already exist. This was identified as the root cause of the ghost upload issue. The fix pattern was applied to other file copy operations to prevent similar errors.
*   **Library & Purchases:**
    *   Fixed purchased assets incorrectly showing as "unpurchased" after reopening the library.
    *   Added tracking for purchases made while the library is hidden and implemented auto-refresh when the library becomes visible again.
*   **Rendering & Playback:**
    *   Fixed black video playback (resolved regression caused by shader changes in the Image block).
*   **System & Dependencies:**
    *   **Dependency Warnings:** Suppressed false positive warnings about missing dependencies. This occurs when dependencies of dependencies are stored as inline `data` rather than on disk; the system now correctly identifies this embedded content.
    *   Fixed Proton/Wine path handling when loading the WebView library HTML.

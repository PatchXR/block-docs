# What's New

### 🌟 Highlights
* **Variable System Upgrade:** New inspector settings allow variables to **broadcast in multiplayer** (default is off).
* **Raycast Improvements:** Raycasts can now detect remote players and distinguish between the **Head and Torso**. Added a "Count" output and logic to ignore tags/selector lines.


### 🛠️ Building & Logic Tools
* **Wires:** Easier to pull a new wire even when a connection is already made.
* **Logic Updates:**
  * **Recursive Events:** Allowed recursive "Immediate Event" (fixes specific text containment issues).
  * **Wireless:** Restricted channels to no decimals.
  * **Interface Blocks:** Removed "Fire on Spawn" feature.
  * **Block Compare:** Added an "Index" feature.
* **Knobs & Sliders:**
  * **Knobs:** Now allow decimal values and have better Min/Max handling.
  * **Sliderboards:** Inputs hide the frame when hidden; "Touch" mode creates a tighter active area; exponential falloff added for smoother pulsing.
* **Meshes:**
  * New `make_hittable` feature allows meshes to be hit by the player's controller.
  * Spawns in one piece by default.
  * Easier to grab dots when the mesh is scaled down.
* **Misc Components:**

* **Particles:** Smoother trails and new default values.
* **Bubble Player:** playback Cursor is no longer interactive.

### 👥 Multiplayer & Syncing

* **Remote Players:**
  * Edited text updates for remote players when the keyboard is closed.
  * Syncs grabbing and joystick Up/Down movements.
  * Remote player colliders are enabled (allows for Raycast detection).
* **Optimization:** When a player joins, the system now only syncs the joining player rather than everyone.

### 🖥️ UI & Quality of Life
* **World Management:**
  * Copy-pasted blocks will automatically become **Unlocked**.
  * Marble settings reset correctly after reloading a world.
* **Navigation:** Fixed a broken loop when navigating Info Page -> Library -> Info Page.
* **Recentering:** Changed default recenter anchor technique; removed Passthrough recenter on headset unmount/remount.
* **Telemetry:** Added device info (Quest model) and build version to event subscriptions.

### 🐛 Key Fixes
* **Crash Fixes:** Fixed a "hard crash" related to preset connections and crashes related to the WebView dispatcher.
* **Assets:** Fixed "All My Assets" loading empty after an app restart.
* **Spawning:** Fixed issues with spawning from the Library while trying to connect streams/snaps on the grid.
* **Search:** Search results now correctly populate the Block Name/File Path.

## 🛠️ Building & Logic

*New tools and refinements for world creators.*

* **Precision Grid:** Added a **1cm spacing** setting for high-detail building.
* **Gen AI 3D Models:** New `gen_mesh` console command allows you to generate 3D models from images or URLs.
* **Improved Logic Blocks:**
* **Foreach Block:** Added a "Once Per Frame" limit (enabled by default) to prevent logic glitches and performance spikes.
* **Constant Block:** Now includes a toggle to detect if the game is in **Play or Edit mode**.
* **Controller Output:** You can now disable default UI/gameplay inputs to reserve controller buttons exclusively for your custom block logic.
* **Particles:** Added a Jolt input to manually trigger specific particle counts. The "helper sphere" is now invisible in Play mode.
* **Procedural Line:** Added an option to face custom directions rather than always tracking the player.


* **Workflow Fixes:** * Fixed "Stream Inputs" in the **Get Block** and **Function Stream** blocks that were previously difficult to edit.
* Interaction areas for Sliders and Dials have been tightened so you don't accidentally grab them while working on neighboring blocks.
* **Integrator Block:** Expanded the connection area for Jolt inputs to make wiring easier.

## 🏃 Physics & Player Movement

*Weightier movement and improved stability.*

* **Gaining Weight:** Standardized player mass to **60kg** (up from 1kg). You will now feel much more grounded and less like a floating balloon.
* **Anti-Fling Measures:** Implemented several fixes to prevent players from being randomly launched into orbit by physics glitches.
* **Make Physical Extra:** A new block that provides expanded physics options and better toggling for multiplayer objects.
* **Player Locking:** The **Set Lock** block now correctly prevents players from moving when activated.
* **Collision Logic:** * Groups now have a "Collide When Hidden" option.
* Raycasts now correctly ignore triggers and non-collidable blocks.

## 🌐 Multiplayer & Social

*Smoother connections and better sync.*

* **Avatar Visibility:** Fixed the "Ghost" bug where players would sometimes appear invisible in sessions.
* **Consistency:** The Player list now outputs in the same order for everyone, and the "All Players" output now correctly includes the local player in single-player mode.
* **Connection Stability:** * Reduced crashes when joining multiplayer worlds or exiting specific episodes.
* Improved login session recovery to prevent unexpected logouts.
* Deduplicated "Join" requests to make entering a world faster and more reliable.

## 📦 Assets & Library

*Managing your content just got easier.*

* **Asset Inspector:** Added an "Asset Info" display for Samples, Images, and Videos, including owner info and direct links to asset pages.
* **360 Video Support:** Added a dedicated `is360` toggle and conversion options within the in-app inspector.
* **Purchase Fixes:** Resolved an issue where purchased assets would occasionally show as "unpurchased." You can now also copy/paste within purchased devices to customize them without breaking content protections.
* **Reliable Uploads:** Fixed a bug on Android where saving worlds containing "ghosts" would get stuck on the upload screen.

## 🧠 Performance & System

*Under-the-hood optimizations to keep things snappy.*

* **Major Memory Savings:** Cleaned up textures and shaders to reduce memory usage by approximately **377MB**.
* **Audio Stability:** Moved audio buffer processing to its own thread to prevent the game from freezing during heavy audio loads.
* **Input Fixes:** Improved WebView and Library text input, fixing issues with the keyboard closing unexpectedly or duplicating text.
* **Desktop Improvements:** Fixed issues where desktop players could move out of the camera's view or interact inconsistently with buttons.

# 🚀 Motion Blocks

This category contains **26** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[Block Get Look](./block_get_look.md)** - Output angle between front/right or up direction of the origin, and the target position.
- **[Block Get Rotation](./block_get_rotation.md)** - 
- **[Center Of Mass](./center_of_mass.md)** - Set the physical center of mass of a group. (to be used in combination with Make Physical)
- **[Fan](./fan.md)** - Propels marbles when they pass in front of the fan.
- **[Field](./field.md)** - Add Force or Gravity to all blocks inside.
- **[Follow](./block_follow.md)** - Attach blocks or the player to a moving block.
- **[Get Distance](./block_distance.md)** - 
- **[Get Position](./block_relative_position.md)** - Get X,Y,Z position of the connected block ("target" input). Can also get position relative to ano...
- **[Gravity](./gravity.md)** - 
- **[Joint](./joint.md)** - Let you connect two physical parts together and control / constrain rotation. (let you make robot...
- **[Make Hittable](./set_hittable.md)** - Add the ability to be hit to any block. Outputs hit velocity, and the two colliding blocks.
- **[Make Physical](./make_physical.md)** - Make blocks able to collide, be thrown or subject to gravity.
- **[Marble Random Gate](./marblerandomgate.md)** - 
- **[Marble Slide](./marbleslide.md)** - A slide that will guide marbles with realistic physics.
- **[Marble Spawner](./m_spawner.md)** - 
- **[Marble Tube](./marbletube.md)** - A tube with a funnel that will catch and guide marbles.
- **[Meter](./position.md)** - Outputs the position of itself (or group it's inside). Works either relative to the world origin ...
- **[Piston](./piston.md)** - Used to attach two blocks together and let you set the distance between the two (to make suspensi...
- **[Rail](./rail.md)** - Attach other blocks to it use click and drag. Then changing its input value will translate them.
- **[Rotor](./rotor.md)** - Attach other blocks to it use click and drag. Then changing its input value will rotate them.
- **[Set Look At](./block_lookat.md)** - 
- **[Set Position](./block_set_position.md)** - Change position of the "target" block. You can give an optional "origin" block, it will then posi...
- **[Set Rotation](./block_set_rotation.md)** - 
- **[Speedometer](./speed.md)** - Outputs the speed and acceleration. Use inside groups to make e.g. shakers, and other instruments...
- **[Thruster](./thruster.md)** - Will propel the device it's attached to. Activated using a jolt input.
- **[Wing](./wing.md)** - Gives basic aerodynamics to your physical group. The more the wing is tilted compared to the dire...

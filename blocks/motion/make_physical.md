## Description

Make blocks able to collide, be thrown or subject to gravity.

## Inputs, Outputs and Parts

**Physic objects**: Click and drag to make objects physical.

**Mass (kg)**: Will affect collision with other.

**Drag**: Continuously slow down the speed of the object.

**Rotation Drag**: Continuously slow down the rotation of the object.

**Magnet Force**: Putting a positive value will attract other blocks with positive value, and repel ones with negative.

**Bounciness**: 0-1 value controlling the bounce when colliding to other blocks (Average of both blocks' bounciness will be taken into account)

**Friction**: Takes any value from 0 to infinity. (Average of both blocks' friction will be taken into account)

**Gravity**: 

**Gravity**: 0 : no gravity, 1 : gravity is applied to the object.

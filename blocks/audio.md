This category contains **29** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[Allpass2](./audio/allpass2)** - Second order allpass filter for implementing phasors and such.
- **[Bubble](./audio/bubble)** - Bubble can be used to play an audio sample.
- **[Bubble Player](./audio/bubble_player)** - Interface for connecting an audio sample bubble with the rest of your patch.
- **[Bubble Recorder](./audio/bubble_recorder)** - Tool for recording new audio into a sample bubble.
- **[Clamp](./audio/clamp)** - Clamps a value inside a specified range - meaning, input is truncated within the range from set m...
- **[Clock](./audio/clock)** - The clock allows you to set an increase to your given value every second.
- **[Delay](./audio/delay)** - Creates an audio-rate delay line with streams.
- **[Envelope](./audio/envelope)** - Generates attack/decay envelopes of various shapes
- **[Eq Band](./audio/filter_eq)** - A filter EQ for boosting or cutting bass, treble, and mid-range frequencies
- **[Filter](./audio/filter)** - Shapes your sound by cutting frequencies. Select a type (Low-Pass, High-Pass, or Band-Pass) to co...
- **[Function Stream](./audio/function_stream)** - Let you use math functions: sin, cos, tanh, floor, round, ceil, absolute, 1-x, sign, midi to freq...
- **[Funnle Stream](./audio/reverse_route_stream)** - 
- **[Integrator](./audio/integrator)** - A leaky integrator with separate constants for the rise and fall time. This block can be used to ...
- **[Listener](./audio/listener)** - Listen to all output blocks, mix them all into a single audio signal and output it.
- **[Map Stream](./audio/map)** - Scales values from one range to another.
- **[Math Stream](./audio/math)** - Do a math operation on 2 inputs: sum/add, subtract, multiple, divide, power (exponent), logarithm...
- **[Microphone](./audio/microphone)** - Outputs microphone audio signal as a stream.
- **[Noise](./audio/noise)** - Generates white noise - a signal with uniform energy across the frequency spectrum.
- **[Oscillator](./audio/oscillator)** - An oscillator with four waveform modes: sinusoid, triangle, sawtooth & square. Frequency is set i...
- **[Pitch Shifter](./audio/pitchshifter)** - Transpose sound in real time.
- **[Reverb](./audio/reverb)** - Adds spaciousness and depth to your sound with two distinct reverb types: a clean digital hall an...
- **[Sample And Hold](./audio/sample_and_hold)** - Stores the value of a signal when a clock or event is received.
- **[Speaker](./audio/output)** - A simple speaker, sends sound signal from Patch to the currently active audio output.
- **[Spectrum Capture](./audio/spectrum_capture)** - Does fft (spectrum) analysis of the incoming signal and let's you read it out via a cursor input.
- **[State Filter](./audio/statevariable)** - A state variable filter, with center frequency, resonance and filter type settings.
- **[Stream Capture](./audio/stream_capture)** - Captures and downsamples streams so they can be used with e.g. the procedural_line block.
- **[String](./audio/string)** - A string (like a guitar string) you can strike with your controller or hit with marbles to make s...
- **[Tempo](./audio/rhythm)** - Outputs events at musical intervals. The master "Beat Time" is used as the default clock, unless ...
- **[Wavefolder](./audio/wavefolder)** - A wave shaper that looks for values out of the [-1 and 1] range and mirrors the excess back into ...

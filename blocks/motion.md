# 🚀 Motion Blocks

This category contains **26** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[Block Get Look](./motion/block_get_look)** - Output angle between front/right or up direction of the origin, and the target position.
- **[Block Get Rotation](./motion/block_get_rotation)** - 
- **[Center Of Mass](./motion/center_of_mass)** - Set the physical center of mass of a group. (to be used in combination with Make Physical)
- **[Fan](./motion/fan)** - Propels marbles when they pass in front of the fan.
- **[Field](./motion/field)** - Add Force or Gravity to all blocks inside.
- **[Follow](./motion/block_follow)** - Attach blocks or the player to a moving block.
- **[Get Distance](./motion/block_distance)** - 
- **[Get Position](./motion/block_relative_position)** - Get X,Y,Z position of the connected block ("target" input). Can also get position relative to ano...
- **[Gravity](./motion/gravity)** - 
- **[Joint](./motion/joint)** - Let you connect two physical parts together and control / constrain rotation. (let you make robot...
- **[Make Hittable](./motion/set_hittable)** - Add the ability to be hit to any block. Outputs hit velocity, and the two colliding blocks.
- **[Make Physical](./motion/make_physical)** - Make blocks able to collide, be thrown or subject to gravity.
- **[Marble Random Gate](./motion/marblerandomgate)** - 
- **[Marble Slide](./motion/marbleslide)** - A slide that will guide marbles with realistic physics.
- **[Marble Spawner](./motion/m_spawner)** - 
- **[Marble Tube](./motion/marbletube)** - A tube with a funnel that will catch and guide marbles.
- **[Meter](./motion/position)** - Outputs the position of itself (or group it's inside). Works either relative to the world origin ...
- **[Piston](./motion/piston)** - Used to attach two blocks together and let you set the distance between the two (to make suspensi...
- **[Rail](./motion/rail)** - Attach other blocks to it use click and drag. Then changing its input value will translate them.
- **[Rotor](./motion/rotor)** - Attach other blocks to it use click and drag. Then changing its input value will rotate them.
- **[Set Look At](./motion/block_lookat)** - 
- **[Set Position](./motion/block_set_position)** - Change position of the "target" block. You can give an optional "origin" block, it will then posi...
- **[Set Rotation](./motion/block_set_rotation)** - 
- **[Speedometer](./motion/speed)** - Outputs the speed and acceleration. Use inside groups to make e.g. shakers, and other instruments...
- **[Thruster](./motion/thruster)** - Will propel the device it's attached to. Activated using a jolt input.
- **[Wing](./motion/wing)** - Gives basic aerodynamics to your physical group. The more the wing is tilted compared to the dire...

# 🧠 Logic Blocks

This category contains **23** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[Bernoulli](./logic/bernoulli)** - Routes an incoming jolt to either of two outputs based on probability. With probability value set...
- **[Compare](./logic/compare)** - Compares a jolt value with a stream value and outputs result of the comparison in the form of a b...
- **[Constant](./logic/constant)** - Outputs various useful math constants:
pi: the trigonometric constant
sr: sample rate
sp: sample ...
- **[Counter](./logic/cyclecounter)** - Counts the number of received jolts in a looping manner.
- **[Data Array](./logic/data_array)** - Store and retrieve values from an array using indices to build presets, sequencers, etc..
- **[Delay Jolt](./logic/delay_jolt_2)** - 
- **[Function Jolt](./logic/function)** - Let you use math functions: sin, cos, tanh, floor, round, ceil, absolute, 1-x, sign, midi to freq...
- **[Funnel Jolt](./logic/route_reverse)** - Combines N inputs into 1 output. An index can be given to filter which value will be passed to th...
- **[Gate](./logic/gate)** - Allows or disallows jolts to pass based on the set stream value.
- **[Get](./logic/get)** - Emits jolt event when triggered. Value is determined by the stream input.
- **[If Else](./logic/if_else)** - Compares a jolt value with a stream value and outputs a jolt value through one of the two outputs...
- **[Knob Board](./logic/knobboard)** - Editable array of knobs.
- **[Map Jolt](./logic/map_jolt)** - Scales values from one range to another.
- **[Math Jolt](./logic/operation)** - Let you do all arithmetic operations: sum/add, subtract, multiple, divide, power (exponent), loga...
- **[Metronome](./logic/metronome)** - Ticks off regular events at a specified interval.
- **[Random](./logic/random)** - Outputs a random decimal number between 0 and <b>Max</b>.
- **[Rangedfor](./logic/rangedfor)** - Instantly sends N events, from zero to N-1, when triggered.
- **[Route](./logic/route)** - Let you route a signal with different behaviors: based on given index, loop (one after another), ...
- **[Scaler](./logic/keyboard)** - A keyboard interface that can be used to play notes by pressing the keys or to play music from a ...
- **[Sliderboard](./logic/sliderboard)** - Editable array of silders.
- **[Sliderboard](./logic/sliderboard2)** - Editable, resizable array of sliders.
- **[Toggleboard](./logic/toggleboard)** - Editable, resizable array of toggles.
- **[Watcher](./logic/watcher)** - Compares two stream values. Every time the condition is met, signal output will send the value of 1.

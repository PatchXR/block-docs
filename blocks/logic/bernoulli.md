## Description

Routes an incoming jolt to either of two outputs based on probability. With probability value set closer to 0 the jolt will more like go though output A, while if value will be set closer to 1 - though output B.

## Inputs, Outputs and Parts

**Probability** *(stream input)*: Probability distribution value.

**Output A** *(jolt output)*: Emits jolt value based on set probability.

**Output B** *(jolt output)*: Emits jolt value based on set probability.

**Input** *(jolt input)*: Receives jolt value which will be passed to either of the outputs.

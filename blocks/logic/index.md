This category contains **18** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[bernoulli](./bernoulli.md)** - Routes an incoming jolt to either of two outputs based on probability. With probability value set...
- **[compare](./compare.md)** - Compares a jolt value with a stream value and outputs result of the comparison in the form of a b...
- **[constant](./constant.md)** - Outputs various useful math constants:
pi: the trigonometric constant
sr: sample rate
sp: sample ...
- **[cyclecounter](./cyclecounter.md)** - Counts the number of received jolts in a looping manner.
- **[data_array](./data_array.md)** - Store and retrieve values from an array using indices to build presets, sequencers, etc..
- **[gate](./gate.md)** - Allows or disallows jolts to pass based on the set stream value.
- **[get](./get.md)** - Emits jolt event when triggered. Value is determined by the stream input.

# 🧠 Logic Blocks

This category contains **14** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[bernoulli](./bernoulli.md)** - Routes an incoming jolt to either of two outputs based on probability. With probability value set...
- **[compare](./compare.md)** - Compares a jolt value with a stream value and outputs result of the comparison in the form of a b...
- **[constant](./constant.md)** - Outputs various useful math constants:
pi: the trigonometric constant
sr: sample rate
sp: sample ...
- **[counter](./counter.md)** - Counts the sum of incoming jolts values.
- **[gate](./gate.md)** - Allows or disallows jolts to pass based on the set stream value.
- **[get](./get.md)** - Emits jolt event when triggered. Value is determined by the stream input.
- **[metronome](./metronome.md)** - Ticks off regular events at a specified interval.
- **[random](./random.md)** - Outputs a random decimal number between 0 and <b>Max</b>.
- **[rangedfor](./rangedfor.md)** - Instantly sends N events, from zero to N-1, when triggered.
- **[route](./route.md)** - Let you route a signal with different behaviors: based on given index, loop (one after another), ...
- **[sliderboard](./sliderboard.md)** - Editable array of silders.
- **[sliderboard](./sliderboard.md)** - Editable array of silders.
- **[toggleboard](./toggleboard.md)** - Editable, resizable array of toggles.
- **[watcher](./watcher.md)** - Compares two stream values. Every time the condition is met, signal output will send the value of 1.

# 🧠 Logic Blocks

This category contains **23** blocks.

## Available Blocks

- **[bernoulli](./bernoulli.md)** - Routes an incoming jolt to either of two outputs based on probability. With probability value set...
- **[compare](./compare.md)** - Compares a jolt value with a stream value and outputs result of the comparison in the form of a b...
- **[constant](./constant.md)** - Outputs various useful math constants:
pi: the trigonometric constant
sr: sample rate
sp: sample ...
- **[cyclecounter](./cyclecounter.md)** - Counts the number of received jolts in a looping manner.
- **[data_array](./data_array.md)** - Store and retrieve values from an array using indices to build presets, sequencers, etc..
- **[delay_jolt_2](./delay_jolt_2.md)** - 
- **[function](./function.md)** - Let you use math functions: sin, cos, tanh, floor, round, ceil, absolute, 1-x, sign, midi to freq...
- **[gate](./gate.md)** - Allows or disallows jolts to pass based on the set stream value.
- **[get](./get.md)** - Emits jolt event when triggered. Value is determined by the stream input.

- **[map_jolt](./map_jolt.md)** - Scales values from one range to another.
- **[metronome](./metronome.md)** - Ticks off regular events at a specified interval.
- **[operation](./operation.md)** - Let you do all arithmetic operations: sum/add, subtract, multiple, divide, power (exponent), loga...
- **[random](./random.md)** - Outputs a random decimal number between 0 and <b>Max</b>.
- **[rangedfor](./rangedfor.md)** - Instantly sends N events, from zero to N-1, when triggered.
- **[route](./route.md)** - Let you route a signal with different behaviors: based on given index, loop (one after another), ...
- **[route_reverse](./route_reverse.md)** - Combines N inputs into 1 output. An index can be given to filter which value will be passed to th...
- **[sliderboard](./sliderboard.md)** - Editable array of silders.

## Available Blocks

- **[allpass2](./allpass2.md)** - Second order allpass filter for implementing phasors and such.
- **[bubble](./bubble.md)** - Bubble can be used to play an audio sample.
- **[bubble_player](./bubble_player.md)** - Interface for connecting an audio sample bubble with the rest of your patch.
- **[bubble_recorder](./bubble_recorder.md)** - Tool for recording new audio into a sample bubble.
- **[clamp](./clamp.md)** - Clamps a value inside a specified range - meaning, input is truncated within the range from set m...
- **[clock](./clock.md)** - The clock allows you to set an increase to your given value every second.
- **[delay](./delay.md)** - Creates an audio-rate delay line with streams.
- **[envelope](./envelope.md)** - Generates attack/decay envelopes of various shapes
- **[filter](./filter.md)** - Shapes your sound by cutting frequencies. Select a type (Low-Pass, High-Pass, or Band-Pass) to co...
- **[filter_eq](./filter_eq.md)** - A filter EQ for boosting or cutting bass, treble, and mid-range frequencies
- **[function_stream](./function_stream.md)** - Let you use math functions: sin, cos, tanh, floor, round, ceil, absolute, 1-x, sign, midi to freq...
- **[integrator](./integrator.md)** - A leaky integrator with separate constants for the rise and fall time. This block can be used to ...
- **[listener](./listener.md)** - Listen to all output blocks, mix them all into a single audio signal and output it.
- **[map](./map.md)** - Scales values from one range to another.
- **[math](./math.md)** - Do a math operation on 2 inputs: sum/add, subtract, multiple, divide, power (exponent), logarithm...
- **[microphone](./microphone.md)** - Outputs microphone audio signal as a stream.
- **[noise](./noise.md)** - Generates white noise - a signal with uniform energy across the frequency spectrum.
- **[oscillator](./oscillator.md)** - An oscillator with four waveform modes: sinusoid, triangle, sawtooth & square. Frequency is set i...
- **[output](./output.md)** - A simple speaker, sends sound signal from Patch to the currently active audio output.

- **[sample_and_hold](./sample_and_hold.md)** - Stores the value of a signal when a clock or event is received.
- **[spectrum_capture](./spectrum_capture.md)** - Does fft (spectrum) analysis of the incoming signal and let's you read it out via a cursor input.
- **[statevariable](./statevariable.md)** - A state variable filter, with center frequency, resonance and filter type settings.
- **[stream_capture](./stream_capture.md)** - Captures and downsamples streams so they can be used with e.g. the procedural_line block.
- **[string](./string.md)** - A string (like a guitar string) you can strike with your controller or hit with marbles to make s...
- **[wavefolder](./wavefolder.md)** - A wave shaper that looks for values out of the [-1 and 1] range and mirrors the excess back into ...

- **[Clamp](./clamp.md)** - Clamps a value inside a specified range - meaning, input is truncated within the range from set m...
- **[Clock](./clock.md)** - The clock allows you to set an increase to your given value every second.
- **[Delay](./delay.md)** - Creates an audio-rate delay line with streams.
- **[Envelope](./envelope.md)** - Generates attack/decay envelopes of various shapes
- **[Eq Band](./filter_eq.md)** - A filter EQ for boosting or cutting bass, treble, and mid-range frequencies

- **[Function Stream](./function_stream.md)** - Let you use math functions: sin, cos, tanh, floor, round, ceil, absolute, 1-x, sign, midi to freq...
- **[Funnle Stream](./reverse_route_stream.md)** - 
- **[Integrator](./integrator.md)** - A leaky integrator with separate constants for the rise and fall time. This block can be used to ...

- **[Map Stream](./map.md)** - Scales values from one range to another.
- **[Math Stream](./math.md)** - Do a math operation on 2 inputs: sum/add, subtract, multiple, divide, power (exponent), logarithm...
- **[Microphone](./microphone.md)** - Outputs microphone audio signal as a stream.

- **[Spectrum Capture](./spectrum_capture.md)** - Does fft (spectrum) analysis of the incoming signal and let's you read it out via a cursor input.
- **[State Filter](./statevariable.md)** - A state variable filter, with center frequency, resonance and filter type settings.
- **[Stream Capture](./stream_capture.md)** - Captures and downsamples streams so they can be used with e.g. the procedural_line block.

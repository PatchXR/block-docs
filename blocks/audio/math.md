## Description

Performs mathematical operations on two stream inputs. Operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, logarithm, min, max, modulo.

Stream-based mathematical processor that applies selected operations to two input streams in real-time. Supports all basic arithmetic operations plus advanced functions like power (exponentiation), logarithm, minimum/maximum selection, and modulo. All operations work at audio rate for smooth signal processing. Use the operation selector to switch between different math functions.

## Inputs, Outputs and Parts

**Input A** *(stream input)*: First operand for the math operation

**Input B** *(stream input)*: Second operand for the math operation

**Operation Selector** *(selector)*: Select the math operation to perform

**Output** *(stream output)*: Result of the selected math operation

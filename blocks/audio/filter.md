## Description

Shapes your sound by cutting frequencies. Select a type (Low-Pass, High-Pass, or Band-Pass) to control what gets filtered out.

This filter lets you remove parts of a sound to change its character. The live graph shows you exactly what it's doing.

*   **Cutoff Knob:** This is your main control. It sets the frequency where the filter starts working. Sweep it to create the classic filter sound.

*   **Resonance Knob:** This adds a sharp, whistle-like boost at the cutoff frequency, making the effect more intense and aggressive.

**Filter Types:**

*   **Low-Pass (LP):** Lets the low-end through and cuts the highs. Use it to make sounds warmer, darker, or more muffled.

*   **High-Pass (HP):** Lets the high-end through and cuts the bass. Use it to make sounds thinner, crisper, or to clean up a muddy mix.

*   **Band-Pass (BP):** Only lets a narrow "band" of sound through. Great for creating a telephone or radio-like effect.

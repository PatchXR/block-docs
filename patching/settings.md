**When to use:** Only needed for troubleshooting technical issues or running special commands.

## Movement & Comfort

### Hand Tracking
**What it does:** Lets you use your hands without controllers (on supported devices).  
**When to use:** Enable for a more natural interaction. Disable if hand tracking is causing issues.

### Snap Turn
**What it does:** Rotates your view in fixed increments instead of smooth turning.  
**When to use:** Enable if smooth turning makes you dizzy. This is a comfort feature for VR newcomers.

### Snap Turn Time
**What it does:** How fast the snap turn animation plays.  
**When to use:** Set to "Immediate" for instant rotation, or add time for a smoother transition.

### Teleportation
**What it does:** Lets you point and jump to locations instead of walking.  
**When to use:** Enable if continuous movement causes discomfort. Great for VR beginners.

### Vignette
**What it does:** Darkens the edges of your vision during movement.  
**When to use:** Enable to reduce motion sickness. The darker the vignette, the more comfort it provides.

### Vignette Amount
**What it does:** How much the edges darken (0% = off, 100% = maximum).  
**When to use:** Start high if you're new to VR, then gradually reduce as you get comfortable.

## Swimming Controls

### Swim Speed
**What it does:** How fast you move when swimming/flying.  
**When to use:** Lower speeds are easier to control. Increase for faster exploration.

### Swim Drag
**What it does:** How quickly you slow down after swimming strokes.  
**When to use:** Higher drag makes movement more controlled. Lower drag lets you glide further.

### Drift Threshold
**What it does:** How hard you need to gesture to maintain continuous movement.  
**When to use:** Lower values make it easier to keep moving. Higher values require more deliberate gestures.

### Swim Rotation
**What it does:** How sensitive rotation is while swimming.  
**When to use:** Lower for more stable movement. Higher for quicker direction changes.

### Swim Upside Down
**What it does:** Allows you to flip completely upside down while swimming.  
**When to use:** Enable for full 3D exploration. Disable if inversions make you uncomfortable.

### Swim Scaling
**What it does:** Makes bigger arm movements result in faster swimming.  
**When to use:** Enable for more realistic swimming where effort affects speed.

## Graphics Quality

### Resolution Factor
**What it does:** Makes everything sharper (higher %) or improves performance (lower %).  
**When to use:** 
- Lower to 70-80% if experiencing lag
- Raise to 120-140% if your system can handle it for crystal-clear visuals

### Anti-Aliasing
**What it does:** Smooths jagged edges on objects.  
**Options:** Off, 2x, 4x, 8x (higher = smoother but more demanding)  
**When to use:** Higher settings look better but may impact performance. Start with 2x or 4x.

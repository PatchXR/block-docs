Hit record and everything you do is recorded and can be played back on demand.
Any avatar charachters you see in the app, were recorded in app using ghosts.

What is included? (can be customized in the ghost block [inspector](/patching/inspector)
- Controller and head movement 
- Voice 
- Avatar interactions: pressing stuff, moving stuff. 

There are a few ghost recording devices featured in the library, you can search "ghost" to see what is available.
We recommend to start with the Ghost recording station.

At its core, the recording is done using the [ghost block](/blocks/player/ghost_looper)

There are some things ommited from the recording (this means these wont be part of the playback):
- Interactions with ghost blocks
- Toggeling play/edit mode
- Selection tool interaction 
- Opening/Closing groups

# Worlds

Worlds are single patchworld projects that contain your creative work. Each World can be saved with version history, published for others to see, shared with specific users, and linked together through portals to create interconnected experiences.

## Start a New World 
1. Navigate to your profile 
2. Press "+ Create New World"

This will create a new empty world.

## Open a World
While browsing the main menu (hub), press the Play button on any of the world's thumbnails.

Pressing on the lower bottom of the thumbnail will open the World Info Page with more options.

## Saving Your Work

There are multiple ways to save your current world:

### Save (New Version)
Creates a new version of the current world while maintaining the project history. You can save via:
- The World info widget at the bottom of the main menu
- The Radial Menu while in the world

**Note:** Saving creates a new "latest" version of the world. This does NOT publish the version - the public version remains the last published one. To make your latest unpublished version public, you must "Update published" after saving.

### Save Copy
Creates an entirely new world project based on the current world. Use this when you want to:
- Fork a world to create a derivative work
- Experiment without affecting the original world's version history
- Create a template from an existing world

## Publish
Via the World Info Page.

If a world is not published, only the owner or users with sharing permissions can see it.

## Share
Via the World Info Page.

You can share with two permission levels:

### View Permissions 
Users can view the world even if it's not published, but cannot make changes.

### Edit Permissions 
Users can save new versions of the world and contribute to its development.

### Open for edit 
Anyone can save new versions on the same world project. Its always published.

## Version History
Access via the triple dot menu on the World Info Page to view and restore previous versions of your world.

## Metadata
Via the World Info Page, you can edit:
- World name
- Description
- Tags and categories
- Other world properties

Also accessible via the Patch web portal for bulk editing.

## Portals 
Portals are links between worlds that allow users to travel from one world to another. To create a portal:

1. Navigate to the World Info Page of the world you want to link to
2. Use "Grip to spawn portal" from the world's thumbnail
3. Place the portal in your current world

Portals are essential for creating collections and interconnected world experiences.

## Collections
Collections are worlds that contain portals to other worlds, creating curated experiences or themed groupings.

To create a collection:
1. Create a world with portals to other worlds
2. Save the world
3. Go to the World Info Page > triple dot menu > Make Collection

**Important:** You must publish your collection world to make it publicly accessible. Collections are particularly useful for:
- Creating galleries of related worlds
- Building narrative experiences across multiple worlds
- Organizing tutorial sequences
- Curating themed content

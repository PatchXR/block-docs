The Library, often referred to as the "+Create" tab, is your central hub for spawning everything from pre-built instruments to the fundamental blocks needed to invent your own. 

#### Accessing the Library

To open the library, press the **Y button** on your left controller or the **B button** on your right controller. This will bring up the main menu, then choose the "Create" tab.

#### Anatomy of the Library Interface

The library is organized into a three-panel layout to help you find what you need.

1.  **Main Categories (Left Panel):** This is your top-level navigation. The primary categories are:
    *   **Devices:** Pre-built, ready-to-use instruments, effects, and tools. This is where you'll find synths, drum machines, sequencers, and utilities.
    *   **Sounds:** Contains all available audio samples, known as "bubbles."
    *   **Visuals:** For spawning environmental assets, 3D models, skyboxes, and other aesthetic elements.
    *   **Blocks:** The advanced, fundamental components used for building your own devices from scratch. **(Note: This is a beta feature; see below for how to unlock it).**

2.  **Sub-categories (Middle Panel):** Selecting a main category will populate this panel with more specific folders. For example, selecting **Devices** will show sub-categories like `Make Music`, `Utilities`, and `Recorders`. Selecting `Make Music` will further break down into `Synths`, `Drums`, etc.

3.  **Item List (Right Panel):** This panel displays the final, spawnable items within the selected sub-category. You'll see a thumbnail and the name of each item.

**Other Key UI Elements:**
*   **Search Bar:** Located at the top, this is your most powerful tool. If you know the name of what you're looking for, typing it here is much faster than browsing.
*   **Sync/Refresh Button (🔃):** A circular arrow icon in the bottom-left. **Crucially, you must press this button to load any new assets you've uploaded via the Patch Portal.**
*   **Play/Pause Button:** At the very bottom, this allows you to keep your world's audio playing in the background while you browse the library—essential for live jamming and editing.

#### Spawning Objects into Your World

There are two primary ways to bring an item from the library into your world:

* **Method 1: Drag and Drop**
    1. Point at the item's thumbnail.
    2. Use your **grip button** to "grab" the thumbnail.
    3. Drag it out of the menu and into your world space.
    4. Release the grip button to place the object.

* **Method 2: Spawn List (Batch Spawning)**
    1. While in the library, point at an item's thumbnail.
    2. Press the **A** button (on Quest) or **X** button (on the opposite controller) to add it to the spawn list.  
       - You can tap this on multiple items to build your list.  
       - Pressing the button again on an item will remove it from the list.
    3. When you’re ready, either:
        - Click the **Spawn List** button at the top of the menu, **or**
        - Close the menu — the list will spawn automatically.
    4. All items in the list will appear in your world together.

> **Tip:** The spawn list works on search results too. Once you know the button to press, it’s a huge time-saver for grabbing multiple blocks or devices in one go.



#### Key Library Categories Explained

*   **Devices > My Devices:** This is where any custom instruments or tools you create and save will appear. It's your personal, reusable toolkit.

*   **Sounds > My Sounds:** This folder contains all the audio samples (`.wav`, `.ogg`) you have personally uploaded via the **Patch Portal**. The other folders contain the stock sounds that come with Patchworld.

*   **Visuals > My Visuals:** Similar to sounds, this is where your custom 3D models (`.glb`, `.obj`), images, and videos will appear after being uploaded to the Portal.

*   **Blocks (The "Beta" Tab):**
    *   **What it is:** This is the heart of deep creation in Patchworld. It contains the raw building components—oscillators, envelopes, logic gates (`if else`), math operators (`multiply`, `add`), and controllers (`get`, `value`). You use these to build everything you see in the "Devices" tab.
    *   **How to Unlock:** When you first navigate to the "Blocks" tab, it will be greyed out with a prompt to "Join Discord." **Simply clicking this button will unlock the blocks.** You don't need to complete a full sign-up process if you're already here. Once clicked, the tab will be permanently available.

## Quest BETA
To join the quest BETA release channel you must provide the PatchXR team with the email of the account you are logged in on the Meta Quest headset. 
Once added to the release channel, you will recieve an email to accept invitation. 
The builds will then be available as update on your headset.

Once on beta, its helpful to know [How to switch between release channles](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/publish-switch-release-channels/)

Multiplayer sessions often require all players to be on same version. All live events on the app will be using the LIVE version of the app. 

Important: If you are on the LIVE version, installing Beta channel build is fine with update install.
When downgrading from Beta to LIVE, please never update install. Make sure to do a clean install in this case (uninstall Beta and only then install LIVE version)

## Desktop BETA
There are 2 release channels . Public and Draft. 
Contact the team to get the links to the draft installer. 
Public installers carry same version of the app as the quest live version, and available on the download page.

## BETA mode
Beta mode is a special mode in the app, and should not be confused with the beta builds.
When opening the main menu > create tab > blocks , you will be prompted with the beta mode dialog, confirm it to continue. 
In this mode you have access to the blocks in the library. (needed also for full search functionality).
As well as abitliy to group and make devices.

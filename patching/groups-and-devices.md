# Groups & Devices 

Groups and Devices are the foundation of how you organize, reuse, and share content in Patchworld.

---

## Groups

**Groups** are organizational containers—similar to layers—that help you structure your world.

- Groups can be nested inside other groups
- They keep complex scenes manageable
- They are the base unit for creating Devices

### Create a Group
1. Select one or more blocks  
2. Open the **Radial Menu**
3. Choose **Group**

---

## Devices

**Devices** are enhanced Groups designed for reuse and distribution.

A Device is a Group that can:
- Be named and described
- Have a thumbnail
- Be shared with others
- Be sold for **Vibz**

### Convert a Group into a Device
- Open the **Radial Menu** on a Group  
- Select **Make Device**

### Duplicate an Existing Device
- Open the **Radial Menu** on the Device  
- Select **Save As**  
- A new Device will be created

## Groups vs Devices

| Feature | Group | Device |
|------|------|------|
| Organization | ✅ | ✅ |
| Nesting | ✅ | ✅ |
| Metadata (name, thumbnail) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Share & Sell | ❌ | ✅ |
| Library Publishing | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## Asset Info Page

The **Asset Info Page** is the central hub for managing Devices.

### How to Open
- Press the **Trigger button** on the bottom half of any asset card in the Library  
- Or open the **Radial Menu → Inspector → Open Info Page**

### What You Can Do There
- Edit metadata (name, description, thumbnail)
- Manage publishing settings
- Publish Devices to the public Library

> **Tip — Device Landmark**  
>  
> Every Group or Device must contain a **Device Landmark** block.  
>  
> This block defines the anchor point used when snapping the Group or Device to the grid.
>  
> - If no Device Landmark exists, Patchworld will automatically create one for you  
> - If you want precise control over the snap position, manually place and position the Device Landmark **before** grouping

## Paid Device Restrictions

Devices with a price **greater than 0** have special protection rules to respect creators’ work.

These restrictions apply to **all paid Devices**.

### Before Purchase
If you have **not purchased** the Device:
- The Device **cannot be opened** for editing

### After Purchase
Once you purchase the Device:
- You can **open and edit** the Device
- You can **use the edited Device inside your worlds**
- You can **save a world** that contains the modified Device

However, the following restrictions still apply:
- You **cannot** use **Save As** to create a new Device from it
- You **cannot** copy blocks from inside the Device to outside of it using the clipboard

These limitations ensure paid Devices can be customized for personal use while preventing redistribution.
The DRM are still a work in progress and we are welcome to feedback about any ideas you might have.

> **Note**  
> These rules apply only to Devices with a price set **above 0**.  
> Free Devices behave like normal with no restrictions.

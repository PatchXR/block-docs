# Spawning blocks 
1. Start a new world, then open the main menu and navigate to the "Create" tab.
2. Select "Blocks" from the menu on the right.
3. You will see the "beta" dialog, accept it to continue.
4. Use A/X to add blocks to the spawning list, then close the menu to spawn the spawning list. Another way is to use the trigger or grip buttons and that will spawn items individually.

# Connecting blocks
You can connect blocks together to create logic, interactions and more!
Make sure to get familiar with [the connection types used](/patching/connections).

# Block Documentation 
Each block will have description and also description of its subparts displayed as tooltips in the app.
Hover over a block with the tip of the controller to see the tooltips.

The same documentation is available here in the wiki: [Blocks Documentation ](/blocks)


💡 **Note:** These are the very basic building blocks. You will find many more things to spawn in the library, like assets and devices made by the community. The following is focusing only on the very basic building blocks.

# Help us fill up the PatchWiki!
Contributions are welcome! 

Login with your PatchWorld account to gain the ability to edit pages and create new ones.
If you navigated from the Portal you should be already logged in. Check the top right corner.

We have started the process to build the pages and info organization of the Wiki though most of the pages are missing or empty.

## How can you help?
Here are some suggestions of how to help in the most effisient way:
1. **Fill-in existing pages** - Browse the Wiki, find a page that is empty or incomplete, edit the page, add the missing info and save.
2. **Create new pages** - after browsing the Wiki, if you notice a topic is not included in the available pages, please go ahead and create a new page and fill it up with the topic you are inspired to explain. We will see the new pages and will add them to the appropriate path and navigation.
3. **Corrections & Enhancements** - Browse the Wiki, if you find a page which you find has insufficiant or incoherent descriptions, feel free to propose an edit, we will get notified on edit proposals and will approve them.
4. **Structure & Editoring** - Browse the Wiki. If you find the navigation, index pages, paths, or other issues related to the structure of the Wiki to be insufficiant or disorienting, please write a comment on the relevant page or ping us on [the discord server](/discord).

> If you are unsure if a topic is already covered or not sure if your topic is correct or relevant, please lets talk on the Wiki Discord channel:

## Best practices guidlines
1. Add **images or gifs** along with text explanations as much as possible
2. Always **add links** to relevent pages when mentioning features within a page, ex. if you are describing how to save a [Device](/patching/groups-and-devices) through the Radial Menu, you should add a link to the related page when you introduce the term first on your page.
3. Try to use **simple non technical language** where possible, and if technical language is necessary, at least provide a page or link to external resources where the reader can learn Ex. if you mention [Midi Note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) you could provide an external link: 
4. Descriptions and behavior documentation of the **Blocks in this Wiki are read only**, any edits for Blocks should be proposed through comments - the source of the documentation for Blocks is in our code base so we will have to insert it directly in the app and not through the Wiki - please propose your new text edits in comments of the page.


## Current priorities
1. **General casual usage** - think of what will be most useful to know for a beginner that might not be interested in Patching at first, what would they need to know about exploring and starting to create simple stuff, start/join live sessions, and have casual fun time.
2. **Creating & patching** - from more casual creating using devices and gen AI, to deep patching and publishing, try to focus on the essential features that should be known to all creators such as setting permissions, selling your content for vibz, using groups and devices.

## Learn Wiki.JS 
Nice way to learn is to "view source" for pages and see the markdown format used.
